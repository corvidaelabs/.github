# Hi there!

My name is Zach and this is the Github profile for my now personal business Sneaky Crow. You can find my personal github profile [here now][ctrlsquid]. I do host most of my projects on this profile, but it is not a complete history of my personal contributions. You can find my contributions to various open source projects even outside my personal business on my other profile.


For context, I used to use the online pseudonym `sneakycrow` and I ended up using that as a business name. Now I utilize `ctrlsquid` as my personal online psyuedonym.

Thanks for visiting! Enjoy your stay!
